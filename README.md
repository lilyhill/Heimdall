# Heimdall

Heimdall is a gatekeeper app, aimed at simple auth-as-a-service.

It uses django's built in auth system and exposes REST APIs for the same.

### Goal

- Simple auth service, without any riff-raff.
- Should handle exceptions, like unique username, email validation, password hashing, unique phone_number
- Works flawlessly out of the box.
- Future extensibility of modules for complex auth workflows should be possible.

### To Do

- Change email for account 
- Change username?
